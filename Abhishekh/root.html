								<p> Root is an incubator for individuals with great ideas and a serious will to execute them. If you have an idea for a tech start-up that uniquely solves a real problem, and you’re ready to put your heart and soul into it, then you’ll benefit from working with us. </p>

								<p>	When a founder(s) approaches us with their start-up idea, we will first make sure to do the market research about the idea to see if something similar has ever been done before or is yet to be born, and with every single start-up that approaches us, the thought process will be dynamically changing as it should put the best value out there in the world for people to use. </p>
									
								<p>	We will work on different aspects of the start-up like building up the infrastructure of the startup to channel the founder's visions into reality to see how it behaves in the real world, and also legal, business, and funding of the company since they all add up to make a meaningful equation.</p>
									
								<p>	Creating value:<br>
									At root, we discuss and refine the founders’ vision and a variety of other aspects of the company, to maximize the chances of the soon-to-be-born start-up clipping onto a successful track. We’ll do market research, assist with initial funding, networking, product development, and anything that helps elevate your company. </p>    
									
								<p>	Marketing, sales, and customer service:<br>
									Once you've created a fantastic product, execution will keep your company afloat. We ensure the right marketing for your business, put you on the map, and establish a great product-market fit. We’ll ensure you sell, maintain, and grow your customer base. The next step is to meet the needs of your ever-expanding customer base. At this stage, we’ll help you pitch the best version of your company to investors and help allocate the funding you receive to optimize growth.</p>
									
								<p>	At root, we've gone through a spate of case studies emphasizing the significance of financial management. Businesses are bloating their valuations and running their operations on seed money without being profitable or worse, suffering losses. Having a firm grasp of finance will ensure that you become profitable and have your operations running smoothly.</p>
									
								<p>	After building up the start-up to be able to function on its own with the given funding, we will part ways to move on to the next chapter. </p>
									
								<p> The returns we get are directly influenced by the success of the start-up as we will decide the medium of exchange of value initially while negotiating.</p>
